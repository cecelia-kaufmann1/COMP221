It was just a burger. Why couldn't she understand that? She knew he'd completely changed his life 
around her eating habits, so why couldn't she give him a break this one time? She wasn't even

He watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence. 
There was no doubt that he was smart. The fact that he was more intelligent than anyone 
else in the room could have been easily deduced, but nobody was really paying any attention due 
to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence.
