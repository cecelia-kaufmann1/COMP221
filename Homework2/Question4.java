/* You should develop a program that analyzes the performance of add and delete operations on lists. I
would like you to compare the performance of adding and removing to the front, back, and middle of
a list, by filling in the table below. */


//For each cell of the table, you should perform the following steps:
//Repeat this process 10 times, and take the overall average time:
//– If you are timing deletes, fill the list up to the specified size (you are free to use random numbers,
//the same number, etc).
//– Start the timer (you can look up the appropriate timer class for your language)
//– Perform the requested operation n times. If the operation is an add, your data structure will grow
//from size 0 to size n. If your operation is a delete, your data structure will shrink from size n to
//size 0.
//– Stop the timer.
//– Calculate the time per operation by dividing the elapsed time by n.
//When you are done filling out the table, write a few brief statements analyzing what you see. Are the
//values what you expected? Did anything surprise you?
